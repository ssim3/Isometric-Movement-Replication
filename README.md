# Isometric Movement in Unity
This repository serves as a replication of Isometric movement seen in games such as Hades, Transistor, Trails in the Sky, Project Zomboid and etc.
Isometric movement is a technique commonly used in 2D and 2.5D games to create a sense of depth and perspective, where characters and objects move on a grid at a 45-degree angle to the game world. 

# Why Isometric?
Many indie game developers often face challenges in achieving the level of stunning graphics that players expect from AAA (triple-A) games when creating games with first-person or third-person views. This difficulty arises from the complexity and resource-intensive nature of rendering realistic 3D environments and characters. 

The isometric view allows indie developers to create visually appealing and immersive games on a smaller scale without the technical and resource challenges associated with achieving AAA-quality graphics in first-person or third-person 3D games. This approach leverages the strengths of 2D and 2.5D artistry to deliver enjoyable gaming experiences to a broader audience.
